Implementation experimental code using C++ 11 and higher. 
This is all about exploration of C++ and building up experimental code base which will be used in my cantor repo for building different full fledged applications. As Gurt Guntheroth, rightly said about C++ is: "C++ offers developers a range of choices between simple and safe code that is slow and radically fast code that must be used carefully. Advocates of other languages may call this a weakness, but for optimization, it is one of the greatest strengths of C++". It's so true.
This repo is just exploration and getting motivation from many C++ gurus and then incorporating to experimental code to build a base for reference.
